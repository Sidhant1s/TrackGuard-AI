# 🚆 TrackGuard AI

**TrackGuard AI** is a **conceptual open-source innovation** designed to prevent railway accidents by detecting obstacles and monitoring track conditions in real time. It uses a combination of **radar fences**, **on-track sensors**, and **AI-based decision-making** to alert train drivers and control centers before incidents can occur.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

* 🔍 **Radar-Based Object Detection** — Detects animals, people, debris, or obstacles on the railway track.
* 🧠 **AI Classification** — Filters false positives, classifies object types (human, animal, etc.).
* 🛤️ **Track Occupancy Detection** — Detects if a train is present on the track.
* ⚙️ **Optional Track Health Monitoring** — Monitors for cracks, stress, or vibration anomalies.
* 📡 **Real-Time Alert System** — Sends instant GPS-tagged alerts to drivers and control rooms.
* 🔄 **Modular Design** — Expandable with drone integration, environmental sensors, or solar modules.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Railway accidents due to human or animal intrusion, damaged tracks, or debris are still common, especially in countries lacking modern infrastructure. TrackGuard AI offers a **low-cost**, **scalable**, and **sensor-driven** solution to detect danger before it becomes disaster.

---

## 🌍 Use Cases

* 🇮🇳 **Indian Railways** — For high-risk rural tracks with animal crossings
* 🌍 **African Rail Networks** — Where low-cost safety upgrades are most needed
* 🇪🇺 **EU Freight Corridors** — To prevent derailments and infrastructure damage
* 🌆 **Urban & Metro Systems** — For open-track or unmanned section surveillance
* 🚄 **Hyperloop Pilots & Smart Rail Projects** — As an intelligent track safety layer

---

## 🔄 Future Integrations

TrackGuard AI is modular and expandable. Additional capabilities that can be integrated:

* Rail health monitoring (crack detection, stress/fatigue sensors)
* Edge AI for predictive failure analytics
* Environmental monitoring (flood, fog, landslide zones)
* Drone-based inspections
* Solar-powered smart nodes
